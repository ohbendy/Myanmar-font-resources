**Old Burmese**

p26 In Old Burmese, medial La (◌္လ 1039 101C) is also used. 

p27 uni1051 (ၑ) is not listed in consonant inventory on p26. Conjunct forms vary (see https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/issues/1158#issuecomment-753618024)

p27 On the last line, medial La and medial Wa should stack vertically, not overlap.

**Pali-Sanskrit**

p28 uni1056 ◌ၖ and uni1057 ◌ၗ should probably have dotted circles as they are dependent vowels that join a base consonant just like uni102C ◌ာ.

**Mon**

p31 In Mon language, the letter Nga uni105A ၚ does not lose its tail when combining with vowels -u and -uu; instead those switch to post-base forms. Nga does lose its tail when combined with asat uni103A.

p31 Some sequences should be added to dependent vowels:
- 102E (= 102D + 1036) ◌ီ
- 102E 102F ◌ီု
- 102F 1032 ◌ုဲ
- 1031 1032 ေဲ
- 1031 102C 1032 ေ◌ာဲ
- 102D 102F 1032 ◌ိုဲ
◌

p31 Sequence of tallAa uni102B ◌ါ followed by -ai vowel uni1032 ◌ဲ behaves the same as tallAa followed by anusvara uni1036 ◌ံ, i.e. the mark sits on the consonant, not the tallAA.

**S'gaw Karen**

p34 Medial Wa is preferably triangular.

p34 What font mechanism is suggested to allow post-base forms of -u and -uu? ZWJ/ZWNJ is not reliable.

p61 Moken language tag should be mwt as per the SIL website, not mwk.
