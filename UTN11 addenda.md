**Old Burmese**

p26 In Old Burmese, medial La (◌္လ 1039 101C) is also used. 

p27 uni1051 (ၑ) is not listed in consonant inventory on p26. Conjunct forms vary (see https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/issues/1158#issuecomment-753618024)

p27 On the last line, medial La and medial Wa should stack vertically, not overlap.

---

**Pali-Sanskrit**

p28 uni1056 ◌ၖ and uni1057 ◌ၗ should probably have dotted circles as they are dependent vowels that join a base consonant just like uni102C ◌ာ.

---

**Mon**

p31 In Mon language, the letter Nga uni105A ၚ does not lose its tail when combining with vowels -u and -uu; instead those switch to post-base forms. Nga does lose its tail when combined with asat uni103A.

p31 Some sequences should be added to dependent vowels:
- 102E (= 102D + 1036) ◌ီ
- 102E 102F ◌ီု
- 102F 1032 ◌ုဲ
- 1031 1032 ေဲ
- 1031 102C 1032 ေ◌ာဲ
- 102D 102F 1032 ◌ိုဲ

p31 Sequence of tallAa uni102B ◌ါ followed by -ai vowel uni1032 ◌ဲ behaves the same as tallAa followed by anusvara uni1036 ◌ံ, i.e. the mark sits on the consonant, not the tallAA.

---

**S'gaw Karen**

p34 Medial Wa is preferably triangular.

p34 What font mechanism is suggested to allow post-base forms of -u and -uu? ZWJ/ZWNJ is not reliable.

---

**Eastern Pwo Karen**

p36 Not clear why medial Ya and subjoined Ya are both listed. The subjoined version doesn't appear in my resources.

p36 in vowels, uni1033 is annotated as 105C. 1033 is correct.

p37 uni106E ၮ is equally possible as uni100F ဏ; it's not clear to me why 106E was encoded separately, it's just a stylistic difference and both styles are found in Standard Burmese and in Karen.

---

**Pa'O Karen**

p39 Medial Ha uni103E ◌ှ is also used.

p39 Dotbelow ◌့ is mis-annotated as 0137, it should be 1037.

p39 Tonemark uni108F ◌ႏ can optionally take the alternate style made of three dots stacked vertically.

---

**Kayah**

p40 Medial Ha is preferably sloped.

---

**Asho Chin**

p42 Dotbelow uni1037 ◌့ preferably sits to the left of other below-base marks.

---

**Shan**

p43 lists uni109F ႟ as a vowel, but it is a punctuation sign.

---

**Khamti Shan**

p48 Further vowel sequences include:

- 1032/1086 1062  ဲၢ
- 101D 103A ◌ဝ်
- 1062 101D 103A ◌ၢဝ်
- 102D 101D 103A ◌ိဝ်
- 103B 1083 ◌ျႃ
- 1085 101D 103A ◌ႅဝ်
- 1031 1030 ေူ
- 103D ◌ွ (note this is a vowel in Khamti, not a medial)
- 103D 1083 ◌ွႃ
- 103D 1032 ◌ွဲ
- 102D 1030 ◌ိူ
- 102D 102F 101D 103A ◌ိုဝ်
- 102D 1030 101D 103A ◌ိူဝ်
- 1030 101D 103A ◌ူဝ်
- 1031 1083 ေႃ
- 103A ◌်

p48 has -ai vowel uni1032 ◌ဲ annotated as uni1086, which is ◌ႆ Shan final -y.

p48 Khamti digits are attested but not yet encoded.

p49 uses uni1032 for -ai vowel, but p48 suggests uni1086, unclear which to use.

---

**Aiton & Phake**

p51 uniAA6C Khamti letter Sa ꩬ is missing from the consonant inventory.

p51 There seems to be a font issue with the subjoined consonants.

p51 In diphthongs we also find:

- 103D 102F ◌ွု as a ligature
- 102F 1036 ◌ုံ

The following are also used:

- 103A ◌်
- AA70 ꩰ reduplication mark (and combinations with 102E, 1036, 103A, 109D/1086/1032), though implementation is unclear.

---

**Tai Laing** (Endonym is Shan-Ni)

p53 uniA9EC ꧬ appears twice in the consonant inventory.

p53 The following should be included:

- 103D ◌ွ (medial wa used as vowel)
- 1062 ၢ
- 1035 ဵ
- 1062 1086 ၢႆ 
- 103D 1086 ◌ွႆ

p53 Numeral 9 is a 180° rotation of numeral 8, this sideways version seems to be outdated.

---

**Pale Palaung**

p58 Sequence 102D 102F 101D 1038 is represented as 102D 102F 101D **103A** 1038

---

**Rumai Palaung**

p60 Tonemark annotated as uni1089 is in fact uni1087.

---

**Moken**

p61 Moken language tag should be mwt as per the SIL website, not mwk.

**Letalanyah**

Letalanyah is an orthography for S'gaw Karen used by Buddhist communities (in contrast to the S'gaw orthography listed in UTN11 which is the Christian S'gaw). Letalanyah is based on the Burmese alphabet but uses five extra letters to represent sounds that don't occur in Burmese, and also the medial La (u+1060). See [Kato (2023) "Letalanyah: A Buddhist writing system of S'gaw Karen"]([url](http://user.keio.ac.jp/~kato/Letalanyah.pdf)http://user.keio.ac.jp/~kato/Letalanyah.pdf)
