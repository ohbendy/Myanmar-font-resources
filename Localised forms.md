## Localised forms

The Karen, Kayah and Chin languages have preferred forms of some characters, noted in the table below. Where dot below is listed as 'left', it should be placed on the left of any below-base diacritic, inside any medial Ra, to the left of a medial Ya, and below the bowl of the letter Ra. (Its default position is to the right of all these.) In the case of medial Ya this may mean some reordering is needed. In all cases I've seen a dot below always remains in its normal position to the right of the tail of letter Na.

Note this analysis is based on the handful of resources I've managed to pull together; it is also likely that the type used in these is not always supporting the local preferences. Further information or comments extremely welcome.
