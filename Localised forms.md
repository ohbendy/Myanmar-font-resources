## Localised forms

The Karen, Kayah and Chin languages have preferred forms of some characters, noted in the table below. Where dot below is listed as 'left', it should be placed on the left of any below-base diacritic, inside any medial Ra, to the left of a medial Ya, and below the bowl of the letter Ra. (Its default position is to the right of all these.) In the case of medial Ya this may mean some reordering is needed.
