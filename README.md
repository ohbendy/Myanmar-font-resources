## Burmese Sanskrit conjuncts
 This contains a list of conjuncts compiled from three sources:
 - Ulrich Stiehl's conjunct list: http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf
 - Two Burmese Sanskrit conjunct charts received by email

Repha is used when r- is the first consonant of a conjunct, medial Ra is used when it follows another consonant. Medial Ya and Medial Wa are used rather than virama sequences.
