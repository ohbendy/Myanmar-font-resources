# Myanmar font resources
 Bits and bobs for making and checking Myanmar fonts
 
## [Languages](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Languages.md)
This lists the languages that can be written in the Burmese script, with their OpenType and ISO 639 language tags and an estimation of the number of speakers.
 
## [Myanmar alphabets](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Myanmar%20alphabets.md)
This lists all the consonants of each alphabet currently enabled by Unicode. Mainly based on [UTN11v4](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/UTN11_4.pdf) but with additions from my own research.

## [Burmese conjunct table](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Burmese%20conjunct%20table.md)
This shows every pair of consonants of the Burmese alphabet as a stacked conjunct.

## [Burmese Sanskrit conjuncts](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Burmese%20Sanskrit%20conjuncts.txt)
 This contains a list of conjuncts compiled from several sources:
 - Ulrich Stiehl's conjunct list: http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf
 - Ulrich Stiehl's Technical Manual: http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf
 - Ulrich Stiehl's Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit: http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/preview.pdf
 - Two Burmese Sanskrit conjunct charts received by email
 - Tiro Typeworks' list of Sanskrit Conjuncts

#### In my Burmese transcriptions:
- conjuncts are grouped by their number of consonants for easier font auditing;
- repha is used when r- is the first consonant of a conjunct;
- kinzi is used when ṅ- is the first consonant of a conjunct;

#### Following advice from Christian Lammerts:
- ñ is transcribed with small nya ဉ and not big nnya ည
- when Ya, Ra, Va and Ha appear non-initially, Burmese medial forms are used rather than vertically-stacked virama sequences. This could theoretically lead to ambiguity since -kry- and -kyr- would have the same visual appearance.

Note almost all Burmese fonts go awry when more than two consonants should stack together, so rendering here should not be trusted.

## [Burmese Pali conjuncts](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Burmese%20Pali%20conjuncts.txt)
Compiled from:
- Okell's Burmese: An introduction to the script p384
- Several of my books in Burmese Pali (may contain Sanskrit words?)
- [List of Pali conjuncts from Tiro Typeworks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10jaDPY0EcYenspj-iPDqZsCSta1eN46L4QLPXqeYMQs/edit#) (thanks John)

## [Shan Pali conjuncts](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Shan%20Pali%20conjuncts.txt)
This is a direct conversion to Pali letters from the Burmese Pali conjuncts list. Standard Shan orthography doesn't stack conjuncts, instead using the asat character to cancel inherent vowels. But some older orthographies stack consonants; those for which attestations have been found are marked with an asterisk. Note most fonts do not support subjoined Shan Pali letters so rendering may be questionable.
Compiled from:
- Transliterating list of Burmese Pali conjuncts above
- Last three at the bottom of the list are found in one of my Shan writing primers.

## [Localised forms](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Localised%20forms.md)
This notes the glyphs variations needed for some of the languages of Burma.

## [Confusables](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Confusables.md)
Noting the sequences that have similar visual appearance, and how some designs can distinguish those sequences.

## [Reduplication](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Reduplication.md)
Explaining how reduplication works in different orthographies.
