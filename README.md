# Myanmar font resources
 Bits and bobs for making and checking Myanmar fonts

## [Burmese Sanskrit conjuncts](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Burmese%20Sanskrit%20conjuncts.txt)
 This contains a list of conjuncts compiled from several sources:
 - Ulrich Stiehl's conjunct list: http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf
 - Ulrich Stiehl's Technical Manual: http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf
 - Ulrich Stiehl's Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit: http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/preview.pdf
 - Two Burmese Sanskrit conjunct charts received by email
 - Tiro Typeworks' list of Sanskrit Conjuncts

#### In my Burmese transcriptions:
- conjuncts are grouped by their number of consonants for easier font auditing;
- repha is used when r- is the first consonant of a conjunct;
- kinzi is used when ṅ- is the first consonant of a conjunct;

#### Following advice from Christian Lammerts:
- ñ is transcribed with small nya ဉ and not big nnya ည
- when Ya, Ra, Va and Ha appear non-initially, Burmese medial forms are used rather than vertically-stacked virama sequences. This could theoretically lead to ambiguity since -kry- and -kyr- would have the same visual appearance.

## [Burmese Pali conjuncts](https://github.com/ohbendy/Myanmar-font-resources/blob/master/Burmese%20Pali%20conjuncts.txt)
Compiled from:
- Okell's Burmese: An introduction to the script p384
- Several of my books in Burmese Pali (may contain Sanskrit words?)
